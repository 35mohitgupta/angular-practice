****************************** Model driven or Reactive Form ***************************************

With Reactive forms, we create form control objects in a component class and bind them with HTML form elements in the template.

One advantage of working with form control objects directly is that value and validity updates are always synchronous and under our control.

We will be using FormBuilder class to create reactive forms which has simplified syntax. 
We need to import ReactiveFormsModule to create reactive forms.

We can use built-in validators using Validators class. 
For example, if we want to use required validator, it can be accessed as Validators.required
