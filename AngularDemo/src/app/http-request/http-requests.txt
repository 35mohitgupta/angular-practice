While building Angular applications, we might need the application to communicate with back-end services to fetch or persist data. This is done using HttpClientModule.
We need to import HttpClientModule from @angular/common/http in the module class to make HTTP service available to the entire module.


HttpClient from @angular/common/http is used to communicate with backend services
Additional benefits of HttpClient include testability features, typed request and response objects, request and response interception, Observable APIs, and streamlined error handling.
The HTTP get, post, put and delete methods will automatically convert the received JSON data from the back-end server, to any desired type.
JSON is the default response type for  HttpClient.

Note: The JSON object array data in the file should have the same key names of object literals as mentioned in the CustomModel class imported from './custom-model'.
Note: http.get by default returns an observable


Important steps to make http get request:

#. imports HttpClientModule from @angular/common/http; module into AppModule and add HttpClientModule in imports section
#. import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http'; in service class

************* retry ********************
import { retry } from 'rxjs/operators';

  getBooks(): Observable<Book[]> {
    return this.http.get<Book[]>(
      this.booksUrl
    ).pipe(
        retry(3));
  }
